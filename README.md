## Overview
An additional project outside of General Assembly’s syllabus. I wanted to create something fun that I could use and share with family and friend so I decided to build an app which I could upload all my favourite photographs that I’ve taken. The app was built using HTML5, CSS3, React.js and webpack. It was a solo project that was completed over a couple of days.
